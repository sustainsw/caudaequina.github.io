        <h2>What is CES?</h2>
        <p>
          Cauda equina syndrome occurs when the nerves at the base of the spine
          are suddenly compressed which may result in bladder dysfunction, bowel
          dysfunction, and/or sensory changes in the saddle area. The condition
          can require emergency surgery: delayed treatment can result in
          long-term irreversible life-changing nerve damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Patients can present to their GP with non-specific symptoms but have
          significant and unexpected critical findings on their MRI identified
          at the point of reporting. Unfortunately, there is an ongoing
          significant backlog of radiology reporting, meaning that many patients
          referred from the community for MRI will not have their scan reviewed
          by a radiologist immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          A computer vision model that can correctly categorise MRI images would
          enable prioritised reporting of MRI scans with potential nerve
          compression. Provisional assessment of nerve compression with a
          computer vision model may provide improved consistency and
          productivity for reporting. We are undertaking this project to
          investigate the feasibility of this approach.
