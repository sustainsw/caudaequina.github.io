    <h1>What is cauda equina syndrome (CES)?</h1>
    <p>
      Cauda equina syndrome occurs when the nerves at the base of the spine are
      suddenly compressed which may result in bladder dysfunction, bowel
      dysfunction, and/or sensory changes in the saddle area. The condition can
      require emergency surgery: delayed treatment can result in long-term
      irreversible life-changing nerve damage.

      Patients can present to their GP with non-specific symptoms but have
      significant and unexpected critical findings on their MRI identified at
      the point of reporting. Unfortunately, there is an ongoing significant
      backlog of radiology reporting, meaning that many patients referred from
      the community for MRI will not have their scan reviewed by a radiologist
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      A computer vision model that can correctly categorise MRI images would
      enable prioritised reporting of MRI scans with potential nerve
      compression. We are undertaking this project to investigate the
      feasibility of this approach.
