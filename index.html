      <h2 class="title">What is cauda equina syndrome (CES)?</h2>
      <p>
        Cauda equina syndrome occurs when the nerves at the base of the spine are
        suddenly compressed which may result in bladder dysfunction, bowel
        dysfunction, and/or sensory changes in the saddle area. The condition can
        require emergency surgery: delayed treatment can result in long-term
        irreversible life-changing nerve damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patients can present to their GP with non-specific symptoms but have
        significant and unexpected critical findings on their MRI identified at
        the point of reporting. Unfortunately, there is an ongoing significant
        backlog of radiology reporting, meaning that many patients referred from
        the community for MRI will not have their scan reviewed by a radiologist
        immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        A computer vision model that can correctly categorise MRI images would
        enable prioritised reporting of MRI scans with potential nerve
        compression. We are undertaking this project to investigate the
        feasibility of this approach.
